# LUMORA: 5-Minute Pitch Script

## Protecting Nigerians from Counterfeit Products

---

## [OPENING - 30 seconds]

**"Every year, thousands of Nigerians die from counterfeit drugs. A mother buys what she thinks is malaria medicine. A patient takes what looks like a recognized brand. But it's fake—and it kills them.**

**This isn't just a health crisis. It's a trust crisis.**

**I'm here to introduce Lumora—a platform that's changing how we verify products and protect lives."**

---

## [THE PROBLEM - 60 seconds]

**"The counterfeit crisis in Nigeria has three critical failures:**

**First: Deadly Consequences. Counterfeit drugs and consumer products cause preventable deaths every single year. Antimalarials, antibiotics, even yogurt—nothing is safe.**

**Second: Fragmented Systems. Verification is manufacturer-specific. There's no unified approach. No central place consumers can trust.**

**Third: Reactive Regulation. NAFDAC and regulators only step in after damage is done. We're always playing catch-up.**

**The result? Consumers don't know what's real. Manufacturers can't protect their brands. Regulators can't detect patterns until it's too late.**

**But there's a better way."**

## [THE SOLUTION - 90 seconds]

**"Lumora is a unified anti-counterfeit platform built for everyone.**

**Here's how it works:**

**Consumers scan or enter a product code—it takes 10 seconds. They get an instant result:**

- Is it **Genuine** and verified?
- Has the code already been used—**a high-risk alert**?
- Is the code **Invalid**—not in our system?
- Is the product **Unregistered** with AI risk assessment?
- Does it show **Suspicious Patterns** our AI detected?

**Manufacturers register their products and track every verification in real-time. They see which codes are being used, where, and how often. Our AI detects leakage and supply chain fraud.**

**Regulators like NAFDAC get what they've always needed: real-time intelligence. Hotspot maps showing counterfeit clusters. Immediate alerts about suspicious activity.**

**And the consumer? They get peace of mind in 10 seconds."**

## [HOW IT WORKS - 60 seconds]

**"The technology is simple but powerful:**

**Our platform runs on Next.js frontend for mobile-first access—because most Nigerians access everything on mobile.**

**Our backend uses Node.js and Prisma for secure, fast data management.**

**The real magic is our AI core. Using OpenAI, we:**

- Score risk based on patterns
- Predict counterfeit hotspots before they spread
- Detect suspicious activity in real-time
- Flag anomalies that humans might miss

**Every product gets a unique verification code with the LUM prefix—no duplicates, impossible to forge. Users can verify manually or scan QR codes.**

**The whole system is built for scale. From a single consumer checking one product to regulators monitoring millions."**

## [BUSINESS MODEL - 45 seconds]

**"We have two revenue streams:**

**Our Basic Plan: 50 daily verifications for small businesses and consumers. Affordable, simple—₦500-1,000 per month.**

**Our Premium Plan: Unlimited verifications, full AI insights, supply chain analytics, custom dashboards. This is for manufacturers and regulatory bodies. They pay based on volume and features.**

**Early pilots show manufacturers are willing to pay premium prices for brand protection and real-time insights. NAFDAC has already expressed interest in official integration.**

**This isn't just software. This is public health infrastructure."**

---

## [IMMEDIATE ROADMAP - 30 seconds]

**"We're focused on four immediate priorities:**

**One: Complete UI polish and full integration across all stakeholder dashboards.**

**Two: Advanced hotspot mapping so regulators can visualize counterfeit clusters.**

**Three: Rigorous AI testing and tuning for maximum accuracy.**

**Four: Direct collaboration with NAFDAC to make Lumora the official verification standard.**

---

## [CLOSING/CALL TO ACTION - 30 seconds]

**"Lumora isn't just a tech startup. We're building the infrastructure to protect Nigerian lives.**

**We've already built the MVP. We have users testing it. We have manufacturers and regulators ready to partner.**

**We're looking for two things:**

**First: Partnerships with NAFDAC and industry leaders to scale faster.**

**Second: Investment to accelerate our roadmap.**

**Join us in the fight against counterfeits. Together, we can make 'genuine' the standard—not the exception.**

**Thank you."**

## PRESENTATION TIPS

1. **Use visuals during pauses**: Show screenshots of the platform during "How It Works"
2. **Slow down on numbers**: When mentioning death statistics and market size
3. **Emphasis**: "Genuine" should be the word you emphasize most—that's your brand promise
4. **Energy peaks**:
   - High energy during the opening (grab attention)
   - Calm, factual during the problem
   - Build excitement during the solution
   - Conversational during business model
   - Strong close with conviction
5. **Eye contact**: Address different audience members during each section
6. **Demo moment** (if time allows): Quick 30-second live scan of a code—shows it works

## ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: How do you prevent manufacturers from gaming the system?**
A: Every registration requires NAFDAC verification. We audit supply chain data monthly.

**Q: What about internet connectivity in rural areas?**
A: Our system works on 2G networks. Verification can be stored offline and synced later.

**Q: How do you compete with NAFDAC's own systems?**
A: We're not competing—we're partnering. NAFDAC has detection power. We're making it accessible to 200 million Nigerians.

**Q: What's your timeline to profitability?**
A: 18 months with 50,000 manufacturers and 2M monthly consumer verifications.
